## 🧪 Overview

This project applies **machine learning and data augmentation** to **classify and quantify heavy metals** (copper and chromium) in **mulberry leaves** using **LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy)** data. The work addresses the challenges of small sample sizes and high dimensionality in LIBS datasets.

Key contributions:

- A novel **normal distribution-based data augmentation** method
- **Random Forest-based feature selection**
- Classification and regression models for **Cr** and **Cu**
- Partial match of selected features with **NIST atomic emission lines**, improving interpretability

## 🧬 Methodology Summary

1. **Data Source**  
   - LIBS spectra from mulberry leaves artificially contaminated with Cu and Cr  
   - 100 samples per metal, each with 22,015 spectral features  
   - 5 contamination levels (20 samples each)

2. **Data Augmentation**  
   - Synthetic samples (500 per metal) generated via Gaussian sampling  
   - Sampling per contamination level using per-feature means and standard deviations  
   - Justified using the Central Limit Theorem (80 averaged shots/sample)

3. **Feature Selection**  
   - Using Gini importance from Random Forest  
   - Retained features contributing to 95% cumulative importance  
   - Typically ~300–500 wavelengths retained

4. **Models**  
   - **Classification**: Random Forest (RF), SVM, Linear Regression Classifier  
   - **Regression**: RF and SVM  
   - RF achieved the best performance in both tasks

5. **NIST Line Validation**  
   - Model-selected wavelengths cross-checked with known atomic lines from NIST  
   - Cu: 50/91 matched; Cr: 213/240 matched
